📦 Business Case

The executive team flagged excess inventory and rising storage costs. Our average inventory turnover ratio is 5.35, while the industry target is 8. This report analyzes quarterly performance, benchmarks it against the target, and provides data‑driven recommendations.

Dataset — 2024 Quarterly Turnover
Quarter	Turnover
Q1	2.79
Q2	3.64
Q3	8.68
Q4	6.28
Average (2024)	5.35

Industry Target: 8

🔍 Key Findings

Under-target average: 2024 average = 5.35, which is 2.65 points below the target of 8.

Early-year drag: Q1 (2.79) and Q2 (3.64) caused the largest shortfall (slow-moving stock, higher carrying costs).

Proven capacity to hit target: Q3 (8.68) exceeded the benchmark — the operation can meet target under better planning.

Late recovery but short: Q4 (6.28) improved yet remained below target, implying inconsistency in demand planning and replenishment.

💼 Business Implications

Excess holding costs and capital lock‑in due to slow turnover in H1.

Forecasting mismatch (inventory not aligned with demand cycles).

Operational variability — spikes and dips indicate process/control gaps.

✅ Recommendations (to reach target 8)

Primary solution: Optimize supply chain and demand forecasting.

A. Demand Forecasting (Data‑Driven)

Deploy short‑horizon ML‑based demand sensing with seasonality & promotions.

Maintain forecast accuracy KPI (e.g., MAPE) by category; weekly review.

Use ABC‑XYZ segmentation to set differentiated safety stocks.

B. Supply Chain Optimization

Shorten lead times (supplier SLAs, dual-sourcing critical SKUs).

Introduce reorder point & EOQ policies aligned to forecast bands.

Pilot VMI / consignment for high-variance items to reduce on-hand.

C. Inventory Actions

Markdown & clearance programs in Q1–Q2 for slow movers.

Assortment pruning of persistent low-velocity SKUs.

Cycle counting & health dashboards to prevent buildup.

Expected outcome: Stabilize quarterly turnover at or above 8 by smoothing H1 performance, leveraging Q3 learnings, and tightening planning‑to‑replenishment loops.
